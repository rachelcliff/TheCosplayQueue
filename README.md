# TheCosplayQueue

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Create a new blank database and name it "cosplay_queue". Import the sql file contained in the API folder (alternatively there is a deployment script currently being created)

Install the client and api folders into a web server such as Xampp or Wamp. The folders need to be installed into the htdocs folder if your using Xampp, or the www folder if you're using Wamp.

Update the database connection settings found within the db.php file with the username and password needed to access the database.

Installation is now complete, and the app should now be functional.

The admin username for the production app is test5 and the password is 1234.
Regular username for the production app is rctest_1 and the password is 1234.

# Notes about Proj 3
Admin users in the system are created using the regular submission form on the and then their permissions changed in the database itself. This means that all admin passwords are hashed using the PHP password_hash function (one way encryption) automatically. 

## Technologies utilised in this build:
Materalize - Version 1.0.0, implemented using CDN, used to create the display and functionality on the home page of the app.
React - Version 17.0.1, implemented via local installation and node cmd, used to create the display and functionality on the app admin panel. 
PHP - hardcode relating to Version 7.4.12, implemented in the API base case, sessions and functions file to create the database connection and functionality for the app. 
HTML, CSS, and JS - regular use of these coding languages used throughout all pages of the app to create display, look, style and functionality. 

# Notes about UX1
The queue is part of the admin user panel and as such it isn't displayed on the apps frontend and the general user, which is who I interpreted the target audience of this assessment to be. I will have a semi-functional user panel finished for Proj2 and UX3 so this part will be demonstrated then. 

Folders have been completely restructured to accommodate a more streamlined app processs. 

# Notes about UX2
The UX2 assessment and Proj2 assessment has been completed and is functional.

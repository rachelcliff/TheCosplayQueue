# TheCosplayQueue

Notes about UX1
The queue is part of the admin user panel and as such it isn't displayed on the apps frontend and the general user, which is who I interpreted the target audience of this assessment to be. I will have a semi-functional user panel finished for Proj2 and UX3 so this part will be demonstrated then. 

Folders have been completely restructured to accommodate a more streamlined app processs.
